# Zizoo Front-End Code Challenge

## Goal

Create and showcase a responsive React component.

## Tasks

- Create a configurable responsive React component based on the this [zeplin.io scene](https://scene.zeplin.io/project/5aa2574b349af0b2682b1730).
- Create a trivial page showcasing your React component similar in layout to https://www.zizoo.com/en/search/. The showcase should be able to demonstrate both desktop and mobile views. Note that it's not required to make a functional search page but rather more like a Storybook page where you show how your component is used.

## Test submission process and evaluation

- Please provide a link to a GitHub or other public repository containing the solution’s source code
- The solution should be built and run using `npm run`
- Using [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io) is an acceptable alternative.
- We will be evaluating:
  - completeness
  - attention to detail
  - code style and structure

## Estimated solution Time
