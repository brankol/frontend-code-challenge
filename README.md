# Zizoo Front-End Code Challenge

## Goal

Create and showcase a responsive React component.

## Tasks

- Create a **responsive** React component based on the this [zeplin.io scene](https://scene.zeplin.io/project/5aa2574b349af0b2682b1730).
- Create a trivial page showcasing your React component similar in layout to https://www.zizoo.com/en/search/. Note that it's not required to make a functional search page but rather something looking like a Storybook page where you show how your component is used.
